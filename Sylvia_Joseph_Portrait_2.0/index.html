    <h1><strong> Sylvia Joseph Portrait 2.0 </strong></h1>
<p> Press and hold your mouse to start changing the colors of the building as well as my dress. When you release the mouse, whatever color the buildings and the dress are when the mouse was released will be the new colors for the buildings and the dress! </p>
<p> Also, while pressing and holding the mouse, you can drag the mouse across the canvas, which will change my position relative to the platform I'm standing on. When you release the mouse, where ever I was when the mouse was released will be my new position! </p>
<p> If you want to revert back to the original portrait, press any key on the keyboard, and the colors and position will return to its original state </p>
